*be-calculating* is basically the code-first counterpoint to the declarative [*be-observant*](https://github.com/bahrus/be-observant) enhancement, when the full power of the JavaScript run time engine is needed.

# Part I  Enhancing the output element

Calculate value of the output element from peer input elements.

## Example 1a Global Registry, class based

```html
<script type=module>
    import {Registry} from 'be-hive/Registry.js';
    import {emc} from 'be-calculating/ðŸ§®.js';
    //option 1
    Registry.register(emc, '+', class {
        handleEvent(e){
            e.target.value = e.args.reduce((acc, arg) => acc + arg)
        }
    }),


</script>
<form>
     <input type=range id=a name=a value=50>
    +<input type=number id=b name=b value=25>
    =

    <output name=result for="a b" ðŸ§®=+></output>
</form>
```

## Example 1b Global registry, function based

```html
<script type=module>
    import {Registry} from 'beHive/Registry.js';
    import {emc} from 'be-calculating/ðŸ§®.js';
    //option 2
    Registry.register(emc, '+', e => e.target.value = e.args.reduce((acc, arg) => acc + arg));
</script>

<form>
     <input type=range id=a name=a value=50>
    +<input type=number id=b name=b value=25>
    =

    <output name=result for="a b" ðŸ§®=+></output>
</form>
```

The problem is:

1.  This universal adder assumes the target has a value property
2.  We need a mechanism to block / add new handlers just like we do for enhancements

## Example 1a -- Almost the most compact notation

```html
<form>
    <input type=range id=a value=50>
    +<input type=number id=b value=25>
    =<output for="a b" be-calculating oninput="value = $.a + $.b"></output>
</form>
```

Here, we are "commandeering" the oninput built-in attribute (which isn't applicable to the output element anyway).  

Why?

~We consider it safe to include free-ranging JavaScript expressions inside such attributes, having confidence that sanitizing algorithms will strip such attributes if not explicitly permitted by parties who should have a say-so in the matter.~  Maybe if the platform ever agrees to a sanitizing protocol, this retreat from simplicity can be reexamined. 

## Security concerns - Nonce in userland?

Suppose the (ShadowDOM) root node got assigned a GUID (private key) that can only be read by already permissioned  JavaScript. 

In order to activate the script (in this case, compile the event handler), this library needs to read that private key, which can only be done if JavaScript is activated.  The element with the inline script has to have: 1)  an id and 2) an attribute -- hash-ish ? that is the digest of the id.  If and only if that passes does the inline script get compiled. 


Think of what we've accomplished here!  We have now purified the JavaScript's domain to be independent of the UI, if one squints hard enough.  

Code that we can patent and earn Turing Awards with!

Because now, with a little more tender loving care (described below), we will see that we can create a reusable class that can be used in multiple contexts -- anywhere we need to add two numbers together. We've been showing inline examples, but the code can be imported via ES classes located in ESM modules, which is discussed below. 

We can get a glimpse of what that will look like by moving the script out of the oninput attribute and into a previous script element:

## Example 1b

```html
<form>
    <input type=range id=a value=50>
    +<input type=number id=b value=25>
    <script nomodule>
        export class Calculator {
            handleEvent(e){
                e.target.value = e.factors.a + e.factors.b;
            }
        }
    </script>
    =<output for="a b" be-calculating></output>
</form>
```

*be-calculating* supports specific syntax for switching to the change event, rather than the input event:

## Example 1c

```html
<form>
    <input type="range" id=a value="50">
    +<input type="number" id=b value="25">
    =<output for="a b" be-calculating onchange="value = $.a + $.b"></output>
</form>
```

## Walk like an Egyptian

Since *be-calculating* seems like a highly useful enhancement that would appear multiple times in a template / html stream, it seems desirable to support an alternative, shorter name, perhaps for less formal settings, where clashes between libraries can be contained.  For example, this package supports the following alternative (by referencing ðŸ§®.js).

## Example 1d The most compact notation

```html
<form>
    <input type="range" id=a value="50">
    +<input type="number" id=b value="25">
    =<output for="a b" ðŸ§® oninput="value=$.a + $.b"></output>
</form>
```

If you prefer some other emoji or (shorter?) name, look to [this file](https://github.com/bahrus/be-calculating/blob/baseline/%F0%9F%A7%AE.js) to see how easy it is to take ownership of your own name.

So everywhere you see ðŸ§® below, please map this hieroglyph in your mind to the expression "be calculating".

## Alternative element references and/or event names

Anything that requires subscribing to alternative or mixed event names, and/or that requires referencing nearby elements using something other than id's, needs to use an alternative to the *for* attribute, and use neither the oninput nor the onchange event.  We do so by adopting [DSS](https://github.com/bahrus/trans-render/wiki/VIII.--Directed-Scoped-Specifiers-(DSS)) to describe what to observe, and the more neutral "onload" event.

## Example 1e

```html
<form>
    <input type="range" name=a value="50">
    +<input type="number" name=b value="25">
    =<output ðŸ§®="@a @b" onload="value = $.a + $.b"></output>
</form>
```

This still happens to assume, by default, that the "input" event is what we should listen for, but having adopted DSS syntax, we can specify any other event name we may want.   While "onload" isn't the most semantic name, perhaps, think "onload of (changes) to these elements, do this...".  Id's and the *for* attribute are generated automatically by *be-calculating* in order to optimize our accessibility experience.

# Part II Applied to non output elements

This enhancement also supports other elements.  The script will need to be a bit more verbose though:

## Example 2a - Brave syntax

If no other enhancements are overloading the onload event, script away bravely

```html
<input name=domain value=emojipedia.org>
<input name=search value=calculator>
<a 
    ðŸ§®="@domain @search" 
    onload="href = `https://${event.factors.domain}/search?q=${event.factors.search}`">
    Emoji link
</a>
```

## Example 2b - Defensive syntax

To code defensively, check for the enh property of the event:

```html
<input name=domain value=emojipedia.org>
<input name=search value=calculator>
<a 
    ðŸ§®="@domain @search" 
    onload="
    const {enh, factors: f} = event;
    if(enh !== 'ðŸ§®') return;
    href = `https://${f.domain}/search?q=${f.search}`">
    Emoji link
</a>
```

# Part III Sharing the value of output element, and other binding examples

Trigger alert:  Allow for a little head spinning below.  It takes a little getting used to.

The output element can also get in on the sharing act.

## Example 3a Responding to changes of the output element

```html
<form>
    <span itemprop=sum ðŸ§®=@c onload="textContent = $.c"></span>
    <input type="range" id="a" value="50">
    +<input type="number" id="b" value="25">
    =<output name=c for="a b" ðŸ§® oninput="value=$.a + $.b"></output>
</form>
```

> ![NOTE]
> In the example above, data is "flowing" both up and down.  In general, I think it is more natural and easier on the end user for data to flow in a downward direction, as most literary languages flow in that direction.  However, if that is not possible, do map out mentally or on (virtual) paper the dependency tree to make sure there aren't any cyclic loops that could result in an infinite loop catastrophe.

## Example 3b - Gain full access to the element

In the examples above, we engaged in "mind reading" in order to pass to the event handler the precise values we want to use in order to calculate the result.

The DSS syntax this package relies on allows us to override these mind readings, and specify which property to pass.  The DSS feature that seems most useful in this context is probably:

> Thanks but no thanks to all your "mind reading" -- could you please just pass in the dependent elements when they change, since I have full, unfettered access to the JavaScript engine, and I would like to extract things out of the elements that I please without your help?

To do so, specify this as follows:

```html
<form>
    <input type="range" id="a" value="50">
    +<input type="number" id="b" value="25">
    =<output ðŸ§®="#a:$0 #b:$0" onload="value=$.a.valueAsNumber + $.b.valueAsNumber"></output>
</form>
```

In particular, DSS now supports :$0 to specify the element itself as the thing that needs passing.



# Part IV External Module Renaming

If we want to share our calculating code with the world, we might package it as an npm package.  Note that the code is library neutral, so doesn't need to be accompanied by 17 black-hole-o-grams of dependencies, and a cottage industry of boot camps to master.  Just saying.

But as things stand, we will need to specify the name of the calculator thusly:

## Example 4a

```JavaScript
//file calculator.js
export class Calculator {
    handleEvent(e){
        e.target.value = e.factors.a + e.factors.b;
    }
}
```

```html
<input type="range" id="a" value="23">
+<input type="number" id="b" value="252334">
=<script nomodule src="./calculator.js"></script>
<output for="a b" ðŸ§®></output>
```

If we wish to give it a different name, *be-calculating* needs to know about that:

## Example 4b

```JavaScript
//file TuringAwardDeservingAlgorithm.js
export class TuringAwardDeservingAlgorithm {
    handleEvent(e){
        e.target.value = e.factors.a + e.factors.b;
    }
}
```

```html
<input type="range" id="a" value="23">
+<input type="number" id="b" value="252334">
=<script nomodule src="./TuringAwardDeservingAlgorithm.js"></script>
<output for="a b" ðŸ§®-name-of-calculator=TuringAwardDeservingAlgorithm></output>
```
